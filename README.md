# Health Tracker

## Purpose
Keep your health on track using our diet and exercise search tools. The workout section lets you search exercises by the equipment you own and your target muscle zone. Results display the name and description of the workout. The nutrition section enables you to search for any recipe by any keyword, ingredient, or diet type. User can then select a link to view the full recipe in a new tab. With results from both sections, the user can select items to save to a list of favorites that persists when the page refreshes.
