## Description
Keep your health on track using our all-in-one health tracker tool to find exercises and recipes. This project is a work in progress that is currently being refigured to use React and React-Materialize! Check back soon for updates, including the ability to login, save search results, and make a holistic plan encompassing both diet and exercise choices.

## Technologies
* React
* CSS
* React-Materialize
* JavaScript
* Jquery

## Usage
We will update this as soon as the page is finished. The aim is to be able to navigate between a Workout search page and a Recipe search page, where you can search using specific criteria and then save results to a workout plan.
